				**PHP**

*Php is a server-side language.

*In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:

Example
<?php
$txt = "Hello world!";
$x = 5;
$y = 10.5;
?>

*PHP Variables
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for PHP variables:

A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

*A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function:
*A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function:

**PHP echo and print Statements
echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.

The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

*The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value:

**The PHP strlen() function returns the length of a string.

**The PHP str_word_count() function counts the number of words in a string.

**strrev() - Reverse a String

**The include (or require) statement takes all the text/code/markup that exists in the specified file and copies it into the file that uses the include statement.
Including files is very useful when you want to include the same PHP, HTML, or text on multiple pages of a website.

**Syntax
include 'filename';

or

require 'filename';
PHP include Examples
Example 1
Assume we have a standard footer file called "footer.php", that looks like this:

<?php
echo "<p>Copyright &copy; 1999-" . date("Y") . " W3Schools.com</p>";
?>
To include the footer file in a page, use the include statement:

Example
<html>
<body>

<h1>Welcome to my home page!</h1>
<p>Some text.</p>
<p>Some more text.</p>
<?php include 'footer.php';?>

</body>
</html>

**File Handling**
	PHP readfile() Function	
	The readfile() function reads a file and writes it to the output buffer.
